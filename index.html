              <p class="card-text">A personal chef is a trained chef who comes into clients’ homes and creates personalized meals for them and their families for a fee. The Chef will do the meal planning, shopping, cooking, and cleaning and all the client has to do is enjoy the meals! Personal chefs take all the guesswork out of the dreaded “What’s for dinner?” question. </p>
              <p class="card-text"> You will receive a customized menu from Heather the day or two before your scheduled cook day, we will finalize it together and make sure anything you’re craving is on the menu. The day of cooking, Heather will source local and fresh ingredients and show up to your house, unpack and start cooking! You will sit back and enjoy the smells filling your kitchen! Cleanup and storing all the delicious food included in service. Heather leaves your kitchen sparkling, like she was never there!</p>
              <p class="card-text">Chef Heather is working to provide the greater Providence, RI, South Central and Metro South Mass areas with nourishing and accessible plant-based meals.</p>
              <p class="card-text">Typical clients include families, busy professionals, athletes, new parents, those needing assistance through surgery/medical procedures, special dietary needs, the elderly, and anyone who just doesn’t want to cook, or wants to broaden their food knowledge!</p>

                  My name is Win. I live in Minneapolis with my wife (Alex) and son (Odin). Our family has worked with Pints & Pans for over a year, translating to several hundred unique meals consumed. With this sample size, I can definitely say Chef Heather is world class. An absolute star in an otherwise crowded/confusing market. We are sad to see her leave Minneapolis, and wish nothing but success in Seattle!

                  <u class="font-weight-bold">1. Outstanding Combination of Professionalism + Kindness: </u> Chef Heather cooked in our home, as well as off-site. In all interactions, without exception, she was a top-notch professional. Always on-time, efficient, clean, respectful, and easy to work with. More importantly, Chef Heather is wonderfully kind. We always enjoyed her energy in our home, she is a true delight.

                  <u class="font-weight-bold">2. High Quality Ingredients & Sophisticated Menu Planning: </u> We are foodies at heart, and very health conscious. Chef Heather used the highest quality ingredients available with great variety. She was open to different cuisine styles (asian, mexican, italian, american, etc), as well as ever changing food restrictions (from comfort food and dessert to vegan and gluten-free). Even pre-COVID we mostly stopped eating out, even at nice restaurants, because her food was so good. We had a ton of fun planning menus with Heather, but she also routinely provided a great menu without guidance.

But after doing the math for organic groceries or high-quality take-out, we concluded it was a reasonably priced small luxury. The cost comparison doesn't include the 10x time and stress savings. Her food gave us peace of mind at meal time to focus on authentic quality connection, while enjoying nourishing home cooked food. That was priceless!

                    Heather was amazing to work with. I was able to give her only a few directions (I can never think of what I want to eat) and she was able to run with it and make meals that were exciting, balanced, delicious, and, best of all, appetizing to my picky kids and husband. I would recommend her to anyone looking for personal chef services even though I don't want to share her!
