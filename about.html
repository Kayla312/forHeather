                  <b>Hello! Thanks for checking out my page and I look forward to building a wonderful, food-driven relationship with you!</b>
                  <br><br>
                  My name is Heather, and I am the chef and owner of Pints and Pans LLC, a plant-based personal chef service providing nourishing and delicious meals to anyone looking to better their dinner time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the time I was a child I always wanted to help in the kitchen. I have vivid memories of peeling potatoes and even making homemade playdough! As a college student I spent a lot of time at home in my kitchen, making meals for friends and hosting countless dinner parties. I always knew I loved to make people feel good through great food. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have worked in many food service-related jobs, mostly cafés as a barista or serving brunch. The first job that made me realize I could make food my career was a mobile catering/food truck where it was all hands-on deck to make special events go off without a hitch and receive rants and raves about the food and service! It was then that I enrolled in culinary school to become a chef. 
                  This path led me down various food service avenues such as catering, semi fine dining restaurants, brunch cooking, bagel shops, and now, personal cheffing. I started with a personal chef business in Minneapolis and fell in love with this type of work. It brings so much joy to work in people’s homes and provide them with food I know they will love and it will love them right back. It’s so great to teach people about food and build great relationships. 
                  Now, as an owner of my own personal chef business, Pints and Pans LLC is here to provide you with all these things too! I have worked and traveled my business around from Minneapolis to Seattle and now, to Rhode Island, hoping to reach my ideal clientele. I can’t wait to experience the Northeast and everything wonderful it has to offer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am recently married, to my wonderful husband Josh, who works as an Athletic Trainer with the New England Revolution and absolutely adores soccer! During our down time, you can find us in our garden growing all sorts of food as well as MANY varieties of Dahlias, at a local brewery, or on a walk with our dog, Brewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’m so excited for the wonderful meals I can create to put on your table, and cannot wait to connect with you!
